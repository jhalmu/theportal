# The Django

- Django -> addons
- Apps
- Tailwind
- Htmx

## 15.11.23

Added Tailwind and starter template.

- Addon was django-jinja2 which I heard works better than djangos templatelanguage.
  
## 16.11.23

- Added django-partials and try to figure out what to do with pip-tools. Well, I have now requirements.in -file there which I saw somewhere. Dont yet know what is the blessing with it. Al so updated django & all to newest package. I have looking Flowbite and TW Elements, got some tailwindcss components for partials. I want to buy Tailwind UI but can't buy everything. Sadly I'm so insecure and neuro-oddball that I get stuck very easily. Next some basic UI-stuff and then for first apps... and htmx... well I think If I just try to minimise panic and have htmx as a tweak later.  

## 18.11.23

- I stucked to find out how to remove flake8's toolongline -messages. Found it. Â´()"flake8.args": ["--max-line-length=120"]` was the answer. I had old style setting and those thousand other fixes did not do anything for this problem.
